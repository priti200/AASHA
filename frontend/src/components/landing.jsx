These are the individuals who have reached their limits in dealing with the struggles that they encounter. Fortunately, there is a way to change how they feel, and that is to extend your help to them. With one word or action, you can already give them hope. Once this happens, they will become more motivated to continue living their lives. In a way, you are trying to keep them away from hurting themselves.</p></div>

                    <p className='p-5 text-center text-xl  bg-white text-black'>Another beauty of helping other people is that you can start to develop or create a culture of kindness around the community. Take note that the persons who receive your help or support will also be inspired to do the same thing to other individuals. If you show others that they have to help without expecting in return, there is a high tendency that they will also work hard to give back to others. Because of this, you should continue to show consistency in extending your helping hands to the right people.</p></div>
