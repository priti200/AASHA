# AASHA

 A fundraising website to help the people who are suffering from different dangerous diseases and could not afford expensive treatment due to their financial condition. So this website or organization will help people to raise fund for their treatment by posting their problems and ask for help from the people all around the world. 


 ## Problem statement-

 After seeing so many death cases due to this reason , we thought of stepping one step ahead to make something which will connect people who need to help and the people who need the help the most. We wanted to implement something which will work for the wellfare of the people suffering from different dangerous diseases and fighting for their lives everyday. We are still in developing phase , learning to develop a site which can help people to donate in an efficient and easy way and to the people who need to raise the fund for their treatment easily.

## Here are some glimpses of AASHA-
